        <h2>My History</h2>
        <div class="text-container">
          <p class="original-text">
I'm a recent graduate in Computer Engineering from NC State University, where I built a strong foundation in networking, embedded systems, and automation. My passion for technology began in seventh grade through Project Lead the Way, where I developed early skills in computer-integrated manufacturing, engineering design, and computer science principles. Projects like building an Automated Guided Vehicle and a mobile robotic arm using VEX equipment solidified my interest in systems-level engineering.

At Caterpillar, I served as a Software Testing Intern, where I wrote Python test scripts and worked with MATLAB and Caterpillar Electronic Technician to verify and troubleshoot control systems. This role deepened my skills in debugging networked hardware/software systems, writing technical documentation, and collaborating across engineering teams.

My academic focus included embedded network communication, real-time systems, and computer networking. I've worked on microcontroller-based automation, learned to optimize performance at both the hardware and software levels, and gained experience with tools like Wireshark, Cisco Packet Tracer, and embedded C.

Outside of technical work, I bring leadership experience from Student Council and the National Honor Society, and I enjoy activities that challenge my logic and creativityâ€”like chess, coding, puzzles, film critique, and writing.

I'm excited to apply my technical skills and curiosity in full-time roles focused on network infrastructure, embedded devices, or systems integration, where I can contribute to meaningful, high-impact engineering solutions.
