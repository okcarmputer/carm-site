				Engaging with any form of media or A(a)rt is almost always monumental 
				in a person's life. I would say personally it can be life altering. 
				My goal with this site is to reinvent and reimagine the feelings and 
				experiences of digesting a form of A(a)rt for the first time. In the 
				situation I leave a movie theater feeling a sense of connection to a 
				character, why should that end with the end credits? It is my goal to 
				learn everything the artist intended to portray through their A(a)rt. 
				I absorb, decipher, and engage with the art in ways that allow me to 
				continue to enjoy and learn from it for longer than the duration of 
				the piece itself.

				Engaging with this site is intended to be a relatable experience. 
				The purpose is to find more ways to engage with your favorite 
				pieces of art, and understand them further. Within a capitalist society
				it is imperitive that we as humans are intentional about our lives being 
				full, and A(a)rt is a necessity in this area.
